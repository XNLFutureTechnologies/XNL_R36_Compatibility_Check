# Simplified License
I know it can be (and often is) very cumbersome to check what you can and can‚Äôt do with projects, source-codes etc, therefor I will most of the time (in case of open-source projects) provide a simple and easy to understand simplified license explaining in ‚Äòshort lines‚Äô what you can do with the project and/or it‚Äôs files. For full commercial use I would however still strongly recommend to read the entire full license!

# Full License  
## Open Source License
This section covers the source-code files of this software, download, project and/or product.

TIP: Some of our open source programs, scripts etc which are 'open-scripts' (think about shell scripts, lua etc) will often contain a simple and easy block at the top to instantly comply with all the license requirements without too much fuzz üòä. (Given that you don't violate other possible rules of the license like for example: "No commercial use" if that applies to that specific license of course.)
Educative purposes

The main purpose of us publishing the source code's of our (software) projects is to educate others, to inspire others and (often) to give others a 'foundation' for their own (personal) projects (these are the 'Foundation Projects'). Our source codes should (in nearly all cases) not be used to produce commercial products.
Foundation Projects/Downloads

Projects/Downloads and/or Source Codes which are 'marked' as 'Foundation Projects' are actually intended to build and/or design your own projects and/or products with. These are often intended as 'starter-kits' so that you can get started to make your own projects and/or products with it. Projects/products which you have build-up these 'Foundation Projects' can be used and/or published (even commercially) if you like. It however is (obviously) important that you have put a significant amount of work into the foundation project to make it your own project/product. And it should still not violate the general license terms for the Foundation Project (meaning that it is for example not allowed to use a Foundation Project to make your own project/product which could for example hurt/damage other people or damage their property, reputation, business etc).
Commercial Use and/or Redistribution

If you are inspired by one of our source codes and you make your own version of it (from scratch) and are just using a 'couple snippets' to make your own product (which you intend to redistribute and/or sell), then you are allowed to do so. It is however important that you give credit where credit's is due, and that a signification portion your publication (>90%) should consist out of your own work.

Obviously you don't have to credit us for things like for example simple 'if block structures' or a (commonly known/used) simple formula to calculate something. But if you are using entire (either slightly modified or unaltered) functions, modules etc, then you are required to credit us/the original code (for example in the about screen, the documentation and/or the source code).
Reusing graphics, sound files, music, 3d models, animations and/or other elements

In 99% of the cases it is not allowed to reuse any of the graphics or other (graphical) elements included in our source codes for your own project(s). If you are (re-)making your own version based on a source code of one of our projects/products, then unless otherwise stated for this particular project, you are required to create your own (graphical) elements like clip-arts, illustrations, icons etc. The same goes for example for 3D models, animations and audio files etc included in the source code.

This basically means: That if it is not explicitly stated for the project's/product's source code that you can reuse the included images, sound files, 3D models, animations etc, that you are not allowed to reuse them for your own project(s) if you are planning to redistribute them (either free or commercial).
Rebranding and then (re)publishing

For some (beginner) 'programmers' it might seem tempting to just change some UI/interface aspects like icons/graphics, text labels (changing the copyright/creator info and the application name), re-arranging some interface controls and then slapping their own logo on it to (re-)publish it as their 'own program'. This type of (re-)distribution is not allowed and is considered taking credit for our work. We will not hesitate to take (legal) action against this and possibly even publicly call you out on it. Simply because these kind of publications are quite demotivating when people are putting in quite a lot of effort to create educative content/source-code's for others to learn from just for to be 'stolen' by someone-else who falsely takes credit for it.

Am I allowed to make changes to the source code only for my own use, for my dad or for some of my friends for example?
Yes, but read on first üòâ:
Sure you can, that is actually how I myself (and several others on the XNL Future Technologies team) have started programming years ago. It is however very important to note that you are not allowed to publicly publish your modified/changed version online if it's not actually a Foundation Project (which are intended to be re-used and can be re-published). But if you are using our source codes to make 'custom versions' for yourself, your family and/or your friends (while not publishing them publicly) then you are of course allowed to do so. I would even recommend you to share your own 'custom versions' with your family and friends (offline/non-publicly that is of course), so that you get a 'testing audience' which gives you an opportunity to actually learn to deal with 'bug reports' and feature requests by your (small) 'user base' üòä

A small tip though (and I'm speaking from experience hereüòâ): Always keep a copy of the original source code(s) as back up, and make comments in your (modified/custom) code to mark which sections you have used from other people's source codes for example. This way you can still 'back-track' what you did if you look back at your projects decades later üòâ.
Use at own risk

Any use and/or re-use of our source codes and/or portions of it is at your own risk.

## Commercial Use Allowed
Commercial use of this project, product, it's files, download(s) etc is allowed, which means that you are allowed to use it for own financial gain, there could be however (additional) restrictions included in a license (or licenses) which is supplied (within) the project, product, download(s) etc which limits the extent of how (far/much) you are allowed to use it commercially. By using, downloading or otherwise using this project, product, it's files and/or download(s), you confirm that you will first check the supplied content/download(s) for additional licenses to see if there (additional) restrictions which limit the extend of the Commercial Use Allowed Permission Clause, before using it for commercial purposes in any way.

A project/product which for example does allow Commercial Use within your company or organization under certain (licensing) conditions but does not allow you to (re-)sell the project/product would be XEWA‚Ñ¢. When you consult the XEWA‚Ñ¢ License (which is provided with, and build-into XEWA‚Ñ¢), you will find this (additional) license information and/or limitations in the 'included license'.

If the project, product, code, files etc don't include any (additional) license(s), then you are allowed to use this project, product, it's files, download(s) etc, in any possible way for commercial use (including (re-)selling it. If there however is an (additional) license included with the project, product, it's files or download(s) you hereby agree that you will also read that license and accept that license prior to using the project, product or file(s), and that you will refrain from using the obtained 'content' in any way if you can't (or don't want to) agree to the (additionally) included license(s).

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Make sure that you also consult the rest of the license(s) to see if clauses/rules like Attribution Required or ShareAlike for example apply, because even if you are allowed to use the product for any type of commercial use, it could still be that attribution required or ShareAlike 'rules' apply.

## ShareAlike
Our ShareAlike Clause means that if you are are for example allowed to share/redistribute modified versions of this project, product, it's files, download(s) etc, that you have to share it under the same conditions as this original work.

Some examples of what this means for you:

    If the rest of the license for example permits you to modify and then redistribute your own 'adaption/version' of this project, product, it's files etc, you would then need to comply with the following 'rules':
        If this original project, product, it's files or download(s) etc are 'open-source' (provide source code/files with it), then your modified version can only be published/redistributed if you also supply your (adapted/modified) source code along with it.
        This also means that you are not allowed to take a project, product etc with the 'ShareAlike Clause' in it's license from our website, modify it and then start redistributing or even selling it as 'closed-source' only.
        You are not allowed to 'remove' clauses or 'rules' from the original license (just to give an example: You are not allowed to remove the 'Attribution Required' or the 'Commercial Use Not Allowed' clauses from your version/license).
        You are not allowed to restrict the original license with additional clauses and/or rules of your own.

We can understand it if some developers/creators put a lot of effort in 'upgrading' existing works, but that they would not like our (for example) 'keep open-source also open-source on redistribution rules', but all I/we can say about that is: Sorry, but that's the 'game of this license'. If you don't like it, then just create your own stuff from scratch üòâ

The ShareAlike clause (obviously) also remains fully enforced if you decide to redistribute unaltered versions, and thus the same 'rules and examples' as shown above would apply, but to the unaltered version/re-distribution.
